# Single-stage: several routes read Markdown/MDX content off disk at
# request time (content/docs via node:fs, tutorial posts via
# extractToc()'s readFile — see src/features/docs/api/content.js and
# src/shared/api/toc.js), not just from the webpack/Turbopack bundle. A
# slimmer multi-stage image that copies out only .next/public would drop
# those directories and 404/500 on those routes at runtime. Copying the
# full checkout (same shape `pnpm build && pnpm start` already runs
# against in dev/CI) is the safe choice here over a smaller image.
