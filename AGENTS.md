# AGENTS.md — Map, Not Manual

## What this project is

KT-XNK is a Next.js (App Router, JavaScript) marketing/informational website
styled with StyleX. **Front-end only** — the backend lives in a separate
project. It follows the OpenSpec x Harness Engineering template:
feature-based `src/` architecture, mechanically enforced structure and
quality gates, and change-tracked work under `openspec/changes/`.

## Map of truth

| Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Architecture & system diagram | `docs/architecture.md` |
| Why past decisions were made | `docs/adr/` (one ADR per decision, versioned) |
| Project conventions, stack, thresholds | `openspec/project.md` |
| What are we building now? Why? | `openspec/changes/<change>/proposal.md` |
| Requirements & scenarios | `openspec/changes/<change>/specs/` |
| Execution plan (current work) | `openspec/changes/<change>/tasks.md` |
| Quality standards (golden rules) | `harness/GOLDEN_RULES.md` |
| Entropy management & cleanup duty | `harness/ENTROPY.md` |
| Session history & handoffs | `harness/PROGRESS.md` |
| Semantic recall of past conversations | memsearch over `.memsearch/memory/` — see `docs/adr/0002-memory-layer.md` |

## Architectural constraints (mechanically enforced)

Feature-based: `src/features/<feature>/{types,config,api,hooks,components}`
and `src/shared/{types,config,api,hooks,components}`. Within each tree,
dependencies flow one direction — `types → config → api → hooks →
components`. Features are isolated (no importing another feature directly;
share via `src/shared/`) and reachable from outside only through their
`index.js`. Full detail: `docs/architecture.md`.

`./harness/verify.sh` runs structural tests that FAIL the build on violations.
Error messages tell you how to fix them — read them; do not work around them.

## Session lifecycle

1. Read this map → `harness/PROGRESS.md` → active change in `openspec/changes/`.
2. Run `./init.sh`.
3. Select the first unchecked task in `tasks.md`. One task at a time.
4. Implement within the layer rules above and `harness/GOLDEN_RULES.md`.
5. Run `./harness/verify.sh`. Done = verification passes. No other definition exists.
6. Update `tasks.md`, append to `harness/PROGRESS.md`, commit (`feat(<change>): task N.N ...`).

## Verification & observability (evidence, not opinion)

- Quality thresholds are numbers, not adjectives — see `openspec/project.md`.
  Claiming "fast" or "works" requires a measurement or a test.
- For UI work: take a screenshot / run the e2e flow; do not assert visual
  correctness from code alone.
- Logs and metrics for your task run go to their own dated directory under
  `harness/runs/` so a reviewer can replay evidence.

## Failure protocol — every agent mistake is a harness gap

When you (or a reviewer) catch a mistake, do NOT just patch the output:

1. Fix the instance.
2. Ask: what tool, lint, structural test, or golden rule would have made this
   mistake impossible?
3. Add it (or log it in `harness/PROGRESS.md` under "Harness gaps" if out of scope).

Writing the same fix twice by hand is a harness failure.

## Hard rules

- Never mark a task done without `./harness/verify.sh` passing.
- Never expand scope beyond the selected task; log findings under "Discovered".
- Never edit `openspec/archive/`.
- Prefer existing patterns; you replicate what you see, so only replicate what
  `harness/GOLDEN_RULES.md` grades as A.
- **Shared memory is files, not agent memory.** This repo is worked by multiple
  agents (Claude Code, Codex, humans). Durable knowledge lives ONLY in repo
  files: `harness/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/adr/`, `openspec/`. The sanctioned recall
  layer is memsearch over `.memsearch/memory/` markdown (ADR-0002) — recall
  only, never the sole home of a fact. Other tool-specific memory is invisible
  to the rest of the team; don't rely on it.

## Commands

```bash
./init.sh                    # setup + verify environment
./harness/verify.sh          # full gate: lint, typecheck, tests, structure, build
./harness/audit-harness.sh   # validate the harness itself
```

<!-- ASTRYX:START -->
Astryx v0.3.0 · 155 components
CLI: run every command as `pnpm exec astryx <cmd>` (shown below as `astryx ...`).

SETUP (once, in your app entry e.g. main.tsx) — without these, components render unstyled:
  import "@astryxdesign/core/reset.css";
  import "@astryxdesign/core/astryx.css";

WORKFLOW — discover, don't guess. Before writing UI:
1. `astryx build "<idea>"` — START HERE: returns a kit (closest [page] + [block]s + [component]s). No args = full playbook.
2. `astryx template <name> [--skeleton]` — scaffold the [page]/[block]s it named, or study their layout. Templates are reference code.
3. `astryx component <Name>` — props + examples for every component you use.

RULES:
- No <div> — components do all layout/spacing. Full page → AppShell; sidebar nav → SideNav.
- Frame first: pick the shell (AppShell / Layout+LayoutPanel) and budget regions in px BEFORE writing content (`astryx docs layout`).
- Dense data = rows (Table, List/Item) edge-to-edge — never Card-wrapped list items. Card = dashboard widgets, galleries, settings groups only.
- Status → StatusDot/Token; Badge only for counts and enumerated states, never decoration.
- Custom styling: component props first; else the xstyle prop / StyleX tokens (@astryxdesign/core/theme/tokens.stylex). No raw hex/px.
- Tokens for every value (`astryx docs tokens`). Brand/accent via `astryx theme` — never override --color-* in :root.
- SELF-CHECK before you finish: re-read the file and replace any className=, style={{…}}, raw <div>/<span> layout, imported .css/@apply, or hardcoded #hex/px with the component or the xstyle prop + a token. If unsure a component/prop exists, run `astryx component <Name>` / `astryx search "<thing>"`; don't hand-roll CSS.

MORE CLI:
  search "<query>"   find any component / hook / doc / template / block
  component --list   155 components by category
  template --list    page + block recipes
  docs <topic>       color, elevation, icons, illustrations, internationalization, layout, migration, motion, principles, shape, spacing, styling, theme, tokens, typography
  swizzle <Name>     eject component source for deep customization
  upgrade --apply    run after any @astryxdesign/core bump
