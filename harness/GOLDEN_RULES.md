# Golden Rules

<!--
Versioned quality standards (OpenAI harness style). Agents replicate patterns
they see — these rules define which patterns are allowed to exist.
Each rule states its ENFORCEMENT: the mechanical check that catches violations.
A rule with enforcement "manual" is a harness gap — plan to automate it.
Raising the version creates cleanup work: see harness/ENTROPY.md.
-->

## v3 — 2026-09-04

| # | Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No task is done without passing `./harness/verify.sh` | verify.sh exit code |
| 2 | Front-end only (backend is a separate project); within each of `src/features/<feature>/` and `src/shared/`, dependencies flow types → config → api → hooks → components; no upward imports, no cycles | structural test (dependency-cruiser) |
| 3 | Features are isolated (no direct cross-feature imports) and reachable from outside only via their `index.js`; `src/shared/` must not import a feature | structural test |
| 4 | No dead or commented-out code; delete it, git remembers | lint |
| 5 | Every spec scenario has a corresponding test | manual → TODO: coverage-map script |
| 6 | Errors handled at boundaries; no empty catch | lint |
| 7 | One task per commit; diffs stay small and single-concern | review + PR size check |
| 8 | Copy patterns only from A-graded code (`harness/quality-grades.json`) | manual → cleanup agent scans |
| 9 | Quality claims are measurements against `openspec/project.md` thresholds, not adjectives | verify.sh perf steps |
| 10 | Stale docs are bugs; updating `docs/`/`openspec/` is part of the task that made them stale | cleanup agent scan |
| 11 | Shared memory must not contain credentials or private keys | `harness/checks/memory-secrets.sh` |
| 12 | A `*FormDialog` never renders inside a table's `renderExpanded` callback (a `Selector` field inside it would portal underneath the dialog instead of above it — see ADR-0004) | `harness/tests/selector-dialog-stacking.test.cjs` |

## Changelog

- v3 (2026-09-04): rule #12 — the Selector-in-dialog portal-stacking bug had
  already been found and fixed once (`contracts-list.jsx`), then found again
  independently in `service-agreements-list.jsx` (per
  `harness/ENTROPY.md`'s "caught twice → mechanical rule" policy). Both
  known offenders were fixed in the same change that added the rule, so
  nothing needed to be graded C. See
  `docs/adr/0004-selector-dialog-portal-stacking.md`.
- v2 (2026-08-07): dropped the backend-oriented repo/service/runtime layers
  (backend now lives in a separate project) in favor of a feature-based
  front-end structure — `src/features/<feature>/` and `src/shared/`, each
  with `types → config → api → hooks → components`, plus feature isolation
  (rule #3). See `docs/adr/0003-feature-based-architecture.md`. All existing
  code migrated in the same change, so nothing was graded C.
- v1 (2026-07-24): initial rules.
